### **Networking Interview Guide for DevOps & AWS Engineers**  

Networking is a core skill for any DevOps engineer, especially when managing cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes clusters, and ensuring high availability and security. Below is a structured guide for preparing networking topics for interviews.

---

## **1. Basic Networking Concepts**  
âœ… **OSI Model** â€“ Understand the 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.  
âœ… **IP Addressing** â€“ IPv4 vs. IPv6, private vs. public IPs, subnetting, and CIDR notation.  
âœ… **Subnetting** â€“ Subnet masks, calculating network & host portions of an IP address.  
âœ… **Routing** â€“ Static vs. dynamic routing, route tables, and protocol types (RIP, OSPF, BGP).  

> **Example Question**: What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6, and when would you use each?  

---

## **2. VPC & Subnets**  
âœ… **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** â€“ Creating and managing private networks in AWS or other cloud providers.  
âœ… **Subnets** â€“ Public vs. private subnets, subnet routing, and NACLs (Network Access Control Lists).  
âœ… **CIDR Blocks** â€“ Assigning CIDR blocks to subnets and calculating the network space.  
âœ… **VPC Peering & Transit Gateway** â€“ Connecting multiple VPCs.  
âœ… **VPN** â€“ Virtual Private Network configuration and integration with AWS.  

> **Example Hands-on Task**: Create a VPC with a public and private subnet, configure routing, and set up an Internet Gateway.  

---

## **3. Security Groups & Network ACLs**  
âœ… **Security Groups (SG)** â€“ Stateful firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.  
âœ… **Network ACLs (NACLs)** â€“ Stateless, subnet-level traffic control.  
âœ… **Stateful vs. Stateless Firewalls** â€“ Differences and use cases in AWS.  
âœ… **Inbound & Outbound Rules** â€“ Setting up rules to allow/block traffic.  

> **Example Question**: What is the difference between Security Groups and Network ACLs?  

> **Example Hands-on Task**: Configure security groups to allow SSH and HTTP access, while restricting SSH to specific IP ranges.  

---

## **4. Load Balancing & Auto-Scaling**  
âœ… **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** â€“ Types of load balancers: Classic, Application (ALB), Network (NLB).  
âœ… **ALB** â€“ Application Layer routing for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, SSL termination.  
âœ… **NLB** â€“ Network Layer routing for low-latency and TCP/UDP traffic.  
âœ… **Auto-Scaling** â€“ Scaling EC2 instances based on load using Auto Scaling Groups and policies.  
âœ… **Cross-Zone Load Balancing** â€“ Distributing traffic across multiple availability zones.  

> **Example Question**: When would you choose NLB over ALB for a workload in AWS?  

> **Example Hands-on Task**: Set up an ALB with SSL termination, and configure auto-scaling for an EC2 fleet.  

---

## **5. DNS & Route 53**  
âœ… **DNS Basics** â€“ How DNS resolution works, recursive vs. authoritative DNS.  
âœ… **Route 53** â€“ DNS service in AWS, creating hosted zones, and managing records (A, CNAME, MX, TXT).  
âœ… **Routing Policies** â€“ Simple, weighted, latency-based, geolocation, and failover routing.  
âœ… **Private DNS** â€“ Setting up Route 53 for VPC DNS.  

> **Example Question**: How does AWS Route 53 handle DNS queries and routing policies?  

> **Example Hands-on Task**: Set up a **Route 53 hosted zone** with a weighted routing policy for A-records.  

---

## **6. NAT, Bastion Hosts, and VPC Endpoints**  
âœ… **NAT Gateway** â€“ Internet access for instances in private subnets.  
âœ… **Bastion Host** â€“ Securely access instances in private subnets over SSH.  
âœ… **VPC Endpoints** â€“ Direct access to AWS services (S3, DynamoDB) without going over the public internet.  

> **Example Question**: How would you configure a Bastion Host in AWS to access EC2 instances in a private subnet?  

> **Example Hands-on Task**: Set up a **NAT Gateway** in a public subnet and configure a private subnet for internet access.  

---

## **7. Hybrid Networking (AWS Direct Connect, VPN, and Hybrid Cloud)**  
âœ… **AWS Direct Connect** â€“ Establishing private, high-bandwidth connections between on-premises data centers and AWS.  
âœ… **Site-to-Site VPN** â€“ Setting up an IPSec VPN tunnel between your on-premises network and AWS VPC.  
âœ… **VPN Gateway** â€“ Terminating VPN connections in AWS.  
âœ… **Transit Gateway** â€“ Centralized routing solution to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.  

> **Example Question**: How does AWS Direct Connect differ from using a Site-to-Site VPN?  

> **Example Hands-on Task**: Configure a **Site-to-Site VPN** between AWS and an on-premise network.

## **8. Cloud Networking Performance Optimization**  
âœ… **Global Accelerator** â€“ Improve global application performance by routing traffic through the optimal AWS edge locations.  
âœ… **CloudFront** â€“ AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster content delivery.  
âœ… **Elastic IPs & IPv6** â€“ Allocating and managing public IPs for cloud resources.  

> **Example Question**: How does AWS Global Accelerator improve the performance of web applications?  

---

## **9. Troubleshooting & Networking Tools**  
âœ… **VPC Flow Logs** â€“ Capture and analyze network traffic for troubleshooting.  
âœ… **Packet Capture (TCPDump, Wireshark)** â€“ Analyzing packet-level data to diagnose networking issues.  
âœ… **Traceroute & Ping** â€“ Diagnosing network connectivity issues.  
âœ… **AWS Reachability Analyzer** â€“ Analyzing network connectivity within a VPC.  

> **Example Question**: How would you troubleshoot a networking issue between two EC2 instances in different subnets?  

> **Example Hands-on Task**: Analyze VPC Flow Logs to investigate connectivity issues between two EC2 instances.
