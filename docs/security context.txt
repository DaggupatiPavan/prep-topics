
security contexts



security context:

a security context in Kubernetes defines security settings for pods and containers - these controls access and privileges controls and user capabilities within the containerized environment

security context can be applied at 2 levels:

1. pod level sc
2. container level sc



writing a manifest file :

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name:
 namespace: satya

 securityContext: 
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 3000
  fsGroup: 2000
containers:
 - name: 
   image: nginx
   securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    privileged: false
    capabilities:
     drop:
      - ALL
    readOnlyRootFileSystem: true
    allowPrivilagesEscalation: false




storage classes:

   this will help to automatically create pv based on the request from pvc

-- storage class must be backed by a sc which take care of volume configuration


---
